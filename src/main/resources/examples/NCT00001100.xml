  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the benefits and safety of the antiviral drug
      ganciclovir (DHPG) given intravenously to treat newborn infants who are born infected with
      cytomegalovirus (CMV).  CMV is a herpes virus that can infect most organs of the body,
      resulting in death in 10-30% of babies with symptoms of CMV. It can cause severe brain
      damage in a large percentage of surviving babies. Children in this study have a CMV
      infection of the central nervous system (CNS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 130 newborn infants 1 month of age or younger with CMV involving the
      CNS.  Patients will be assigned randomly (like tossing a coin) to receive either DHPG or no
      study drug treatment.  All babies in the study will receive standard of care treatment and
      clinical, diagnostic, laboratory, safety, and follow-up evaluations.  Follow-up evaluations,
      including hearing and eye exams and developmental assessments, will be done periodically
      until the child reaches 5 years of age.  The degree of improved hearing among surviving
      patients will be a primary measure of drug effectiveness.
