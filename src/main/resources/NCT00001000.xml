  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the degree and sequence of immunologic enhancement and the cellular resistance
      to certain infections after a single dose of atvogen (ampligen). In addition, the
      relationship between activation of immune cells and biochemical markers of that activation
      will be studied.

      Treatment of patients with HIV infection must address both the primary viral infection and
      the subsequent immune deficiency, which is the primary cause of mortality in AIDS. In vitro
      studies of ampligen have shown it will inhibit HIV infection. Ampligen may also minimize the
      toxicity of many drugs used in the treatment of AIDS and induce an antiviral state in the
      brain that may be useful in treating neurologic symptoms of HIV infection. The time course
      and degree of immunologic response to ampligen remain unknown although they are essential
      for proper use of the drug in the treatment of HIV infection and perhaps other clinical
      problems.

      Ten healthy volunteers and 10 HIV-infected patients are randomized between ampligen or
      placebo group. Five volunteers in each group receive a single dose of ampligen on day 1 and
      a single dose of placebo on day 8. The other 5 volunteers receive the drug and placebo on
      day 8 and 1, respectively. Seven days of observation and testing follow each administration
      of drug or placebo and also allow the body to eliminate the drug.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients' general good health should be determined by screening history, physical
        examination, and laboratory tests including CBC with differential, erythrocyte
        sedimentation rate, urinalysis, SMA-24, and drug screen within the established limits of
        normal for the hospital laboratory.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        The following subjects will be excluded from the study:

          -  Volunteers with clinically apparent viral disease or other illnesses, including
             allergies, within 2 weeks prior to the study or conditions which predispose them to
             chronic immune stimulation.

        Concurrent Medication:
